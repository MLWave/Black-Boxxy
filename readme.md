# Black Boxxy

Some experiments into explaining complex black box ensemble predictions.

## Feature contribution

`feature_contribution.py` is an implementation of the algorithm described in "[Peering into the Black Box](http://www.ayasdi.com/blog/bigdata/5191-2/ "Peering into the Black Box")" by Gurjeet Singh.

It sorts columns by contribution to a model's predictions. For our black box ensemble model we pick Extremely Randomized Trees with a 1000 estimators. For our data we use an 8x8 digit dataset with 2 classes.

## Dark Knowledge Neighbourhood

`dark_knowledge_neighbourhood.py` finds previous (explained) multi-class predictions which are close to the current prediction.

For data we use an 8x8 digit dataset with 10 classes. For our black box model we use an average of SVM with a linear kernel and Extremely Randomized Trees with a 1000 estimators.

### Algorithm description and output

This method introduces an "Explanation set". This is a kind of test set used to explain black box predictions. This explanation set may be labeled 
with descriptive explanations (using experts or crowd-sourcing). We store the multi-class predictions for this explanation set.

```
X_train         1383x64
X_test          75x64
X_explain       339x64

Support Vector Machine with linear kernel
Accuracy Score: 0.986667
Multi-Log loss: 0.079983


Calibrated Extremely Randomized Trees
Accuracy Score: 0.986667
Multi-Log loss: 0.070617


Black Box Ensemble model(average(svm, rf))
Accuracy Score: 0.986667
Multi-Log loss: 0.074331
```

When we receive a new test sample (![Digit 9](http://i.imgur.com/F39NgrP.png)) we create multi-class probability prediction for it with the black-box model.

```
Predicted:      9 (0.944547)
```

We then find n nearest neighbours from the explanation set (Note: we rank top n samples that received a similar prediction, we only look at predictions, not features).

We show the nearest neighbours labels (ground truth) and check if these are accurate/consistent. We also report the total distance between the test sample predictions and the nearest neighbour predictions (lower is better, if too high, increase the explanation set size).

```
Neighbours:     9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
Distance:       0.062994
```

![Explain digits](http://i.imgur.com/QzMPLUu.png)

If the explanation set is labeled with descriptions we present the first few:

```
Explanation:    "Single loop. Full bottom curve. Slightly slanted to the left. Looks like the digit 'nine'."
```

Now we take n random samples from the explanation set and add these to the nearest prediction neighbours to create a small dataset. We label the nearest prediction samples `1` and the random samples `0`.

We then train a shallow decision tree and logistic regression (two white-box models) on this small dataset (using the original features) and report 5-fold cross-validation AUC score.

```
Decision Tree:  0.55625 AUC (+/- 0.08926)
LogReg:         0.76250 AUC (+/- 0.08970)
```

A white-box explanation model is eligible when it correctly predicts the new test sample, and has decent generalization (CV-score).

```
LogReg predicts `1` for new test sample, thus is eligible.
Decision Tree predicts `1` for new test sample, thus is eligible.
```

You can build different seeded decision trees, 'till you get an eligible model with decent generalization.

Finally, we visualize the explanation models. The Decision Tree is turned into a GraphViz file: 

![Decision Tree](http://i.imgur.com/yzsVTiX.png) 

and the LogReg model shows the features that were indicative of the sample being labeled "1": ![LogReg Feature Importance](http://i.imgur.com/WO6DHTW.png)

### Intuition

We have a 3-class non-linear classification problem with a single feature x (age) and a bit of noise added.
```
y A A A B B B C C A A
x 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
```
For instance, when x == 6 then y == class C.

We have as an explanation model a simple linear model that can do only a single split. Such a model is not able to fully separate class A from class B and C (it needs at least two splits for this, `x < 3 and x > 7`).

We have a black-box model that can separate the three classes perfectly and can output multi-class predictions.

A new test sample comes in where x == 8. The black-box model predicts [0.84, 0.01, 0.15] or 84% probability of class A, 1% of class B and 15% of class C.

We find 10 nearest prediction neighbours from the explanation set. These samples likely have similar features to the new test sample. We also take 10 random samples from the explanation set.

After turning the problem into a binary classification problem we may get:

```
y 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
x 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
```

This we *can* separate with a single split (x > 6? 1 else 0). We used the dark knowledge of a black box ensemble model to create a much simpler linear sub-problem. Neighbouring samples were found using the fact that class "C" was deemed more probable than class "B".

The white-box explanation may be: "Black-box predicted an A, because the variable 'age' is larger than 6.". Not perfect, but close enough.

### Zero-shot

We leave the class 'digit 9' from the train set and retrain our ensemble black box model. We create multi-class predictions for the explanation set (this explanation set does contain samples of class 'digit 9'). 

Now for new test samples labeled 'digit 9' we ask the ensemble to explain its prediction neighbourhood.

```

```

5 out of 7 times, the 1-nearest prediction neighbour was able to present the correct class -- using predictions from a black box model that has never seen that class during training.

### Mapping Dark Knowledge

Treat the output of a black box ensemble as a TDA function and apply Mapper on this. For data use 10-class 8x8 digit data set, for black-box ensemble Calibrated Extremely Randomized Trees with a 1000 estimators, and for mapping KeplerMapper.

We create out-of-5-fold 10-class probability predictions for the entire data set.

We try to visualize how a black-box model predicts 'digit 9'. 

- We remove all samples where black-box did not predict a 9. 
- We calculate the mean of the predictions
- We calculate the absolute difference between a sample prediction and the mean
- The ninth column abs('prediction for 9'-'mean prediction for 9') becomes our lens.
- For clustering we use k-means++ with 3 clusters, 8 overlapping intervals, and 90% overlap.

![topology](http://i.imgur.com/RMnJUKk.png) 

We can spot which samples are troublesome for the black-box. We can spot different types of 'digit 9' that received a similar prediction.

Using only the prediction column for "digit 1", one can also use Mapper to guide a cluster algorithm on the inverse image:

![topology](http://i.imgur.com/cJN5ohG.png) 

We were able to produce pleasing clusters for other digits than "digit 1", using black-box predictions for "digit 1".

Another example where clear regions with similar digits appeared:

![topology](http://i.imgur.com/WgvU6G5.png) 

Nodes with the digits '8' appeared, solely in relation to how much the black-box predicted these digits looked like the digit "1".

## XGBoost Decision Paths

We use ELI5 library to provide explainations for XGBoost models and model predictions. This replicates to a large degree the excellent post [Interpreting Decision Trees and Random Forests](http://engineering.pivotal.io/post/interpreting-decision-trees-and-random-forests/) by Greg Tam for gradient boosted decision trees.
